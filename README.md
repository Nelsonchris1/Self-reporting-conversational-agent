# Conversational Agent for Collecting Self-Reported Mental Health Data

This repository contains the code and resources for a web-based conversational agent designed to collect self-reported mental health data from individuals. The research aims to leverage large language models (LLMs) to create an interactive and user-friendly platform for gathering valuable insights into individuals' mental well-being.

## Introduction
The Conversational Agent for Collecting Self-Reported Mental Health Data is a research project focused on developing an innovative web-based solution to facilitate the collection of mental health information directly from individuals. The system employs the power of large language models, which are designed to understand and generate human-like text, enabling a natural and engaging conversation between the user and the agent.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this research project stems from the growing need for efficient and user-friendly methods to gather mental health data. Traditional methods, such as questionnaires and surveys, often suffer from limitations like low response rates, potential biases, and difficult in generating insights. By utilizing a conversational agent, we aim to create an environment that encourages open and honest communication, leading to more accurate and comprehensive mental health data collection.
